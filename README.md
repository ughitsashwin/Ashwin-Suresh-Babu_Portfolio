Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am **Ashwin Suresh Babu**, a Masterâ€™s student in Data Analytics at the **National College of Ireland**. This repository serves as a showcase of my projects, assignments, and research work, primarily focused on **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Statistical Analysis**.

## About Me

I have a strong foundation in data analytics, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques. My academic background has provided me with the skills to handle complex datasets, build predictive models, and derive actionable insights from data. I am passionate about leveraging data to solve real-world problems and continuously expanding my knowledge in the field of analytics.

## Featured Projects

### 1. **Income Data Analysis Using Multiple Regression**
   - **Description**: This project explores how various factors influence income using a multiple regression model. The dataset contains 13 variables, including age, education level, years employed, and debt levels.
   - **Key Techniques**: Multiple Linear Regression, Data Transformation, Outlier Detection (Cook's Distance), Gauss-Markov Assumptions.
   - **Result**: The final model achieved an Adjusted R-squared of 92.66%, indicating high predictive accuracy.
